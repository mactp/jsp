      <h2>Get Involved</h2>
      <p>The Friends of Jacob Smith Park are all volunteers dedicated to keeping our park special for everyone — people, plants, and wildlife alike.</p>
    </div>

  <section class="container intro-text">
    <p>From maintaining oak benches and planting wildflowers, to pulling invasive balsam and creating wildlife habitats, our work helps ensure Jacob Smith Park remains a haven for nature and a peaceful place for visitors to enjoy. Whether you have a couple of hours to spare or can commit regularly, your time is always appreciated — and it really does make a difference.</p>

      <h3>Ongoing Care</h3>

      <h3>One-off Projects</h3>
      <p>We also take on larger projects such as tree planting, sowing wildflowers, and adding new benches. These projects often involve local community groups, like the Cubs pictured here helping plant in our wildflower project.</p>

    <h3>Regular Volunteering Days</h3>
    <p>We meet on the first Wednesday of every month between March and October, from 10am to midday. Meet just inside the park gate — no booking required. Wear sturdy footwear and bring gloves if you have them. All tasks are optional, so you can choose what you’d like to get involved in.</p>

    <h3>Current Projects</h3>
    <article>
      <h4>Wildflowers Project</h4>
      <p>Launched in 2024, this project increases the range of native plants to support pollinators and wildlife. We’re planting species like yellow rattle, garlic mustard, red campion, knapweed, and birds-foot trefoil, alongside native shrubs such as alder buckthorn and spindle.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h4>Boot Scraper</h4>
      <p>To keep paths and boots cleaner in winter, we’ll be installing a new boot scraper at the main entrance before winter 2025/26.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h4>Balsam Management</h4>
      <p>Himalayan balsam is invasive and crowds out native species. We’re continuing control efforts with hoeing in spring and hand pulling in summer to prevent seed spread.</p>
