        <h4>Winifred Jacob Smith MBE</h4>
        <p><strong>Winifred</strong> was born on <strong>4 August 1911</strong> to <strong>Dora</strong> and <strong>Jacob Smith</strong>, a farming family whose roots stretch back to <strong>1710</strong> at Humberton between Knaresborough and Boroughbridge, including farms on the Newby Hall Estate at Givendale and at Burton Grange.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, the first son in each generation was named <em>Jacob</em>. With daughters Winifred and Dorothy (born 18 May 1910), their father adopted the name into the family surname so the tradition could live on. Dora, president of the Knaresborough Women’s Institute (WI), and both daughters were practical, community-minded women who played leading roles in the farm and local life.</p>

      <h3>Service, Community &amp; Legacy</h3>
      <p>Educated at St Margaret’s School (Scarborough) and later at Yorkshire Ladies’ College (Leeds), Winifred became a cornerstone of the <strong>Women’s Land Army (WLA)</strong> during the Second World War. She prioritised the welfare of land girls across North Yorkshire and later the whole of Yorkshire, keeping detailed diaries and editing the monthly WLA <em>Bulletin</em>. In recognition of her service, she was awarded the <strong>MBE on 28 February 1951</strong> by King George VI.</p>
      <p>Winifred and her sister Dorothy also managed the family dairy business at Park Corner Farm, Scriven, with a pedigree Ayrshire herd, following the death of their father in December 1941. In <strong>1965</strong> the sisters purchased the <strong>30 acres of Scriven Park</strong> they had previously leased, which later became <strong>Jacob Smith Park</strong>.</p>
