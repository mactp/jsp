    <section class="donation">
      <h3>The Gift of Land</h3>
      <p>Jacob Smith Park was generously donated to the people of Knaresborough by Winifred Jacob Smith in 2003, in memory of her father, Jacob Smith. She wished to preserve the land as a place of peace, nature and public benefit.</p>
      <p>The donation came with the condition that the space be maintained for public use and protected from development — a vision that continues to shape the park’s management today.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="family-history">
      <h3>The Jacob Smith Family</h3>
      <p>The Smith family were long-time residents of the area and deeply involved in local affairs. Jacob Smith, a landowner and philanthropist, was known for his quiet generosity and love of nature.</p>
      <p>Winifred, his daughter, preserved the spirit of her father’s legacy by transforming the family estate into a public sanctuary. Her vision was rooted in the belief that green spaces are essential to community wellbeing.</p>

      <h3>Ancient Connections</h3>
      <p>The land that now forms Jacob Smith Park has deeper roots than many realise. Historical records and archaeological surveys suggest that this area may once have formed part of a prehistoric route between river crossings.</p>
      <p>Flint tools and pottery fragments have been found nearby, and local historians believe the parkland sits on what may once have been common grazing grounds or early field systems dating back to the medieval period or earlier.</p>
