      <h3>A Brief History of the Park</h3>
      <p><em>by Kevin Earl</em></p>
      <p>A research study has revealed that Jacob Smith Park holds significant local archaeological importance and is a relic of a much older landscape associated with the village of Scriven.</p>

      <p>The Claro Community Archaeology Group (Knaresborough) published findings in 2013 in <em>The Chronicles of Scriven</em>. Low Wood at the western edge of the park was planted as part of 18th‑century landscaping by the Slingsby family. Their estate wall still runs along Scriven Road and Scotch George Lane. Scriven Hall, overlooking the park, was demolished in 1954 after a fire.</p>

      <aside class="callout note" role="note">
        <strong>Archaeology:</strong> Guiseley Hill at the top of the park is a possible Iron Age settlement with bank and ditch earthworks and traces of hut circles. No excavations have taken place; all remains are undisturbed.

          <p>Ridge and furrow, evidence of medieval ploughing, can still be seen when the grass is short. A 1629 map shows a farmstead near Scotch George Lane. The ponds may relate to small‑scale iron smelting in the 16th–17th centuries and there is evidence of historic water management in the fields.</p>

      <h4>Winifred Jacob Smith MBE</h4>
      <p>Winifred was born on <strong>4 August 1911</strong> to <strong>Dora</strong> and <strong>Jacob Smith</strong>, a farming family whose roots stretch back to <strong>1710</strong> at Humberton between Knaresborough and Boroughbridge, including farms on the Newby Hall Estate at Givendale and at Burton Grange.</p>
      <p>Traditionally the first son in each generation was named <em>Jacob</em>. With daughters Winifred and Dorothy, their father wove the name into the family surname so the tradition lived on. Dora was president of the Knaresborough Women’s Institute and, along with her daughters, played a leading role in the farm and community.</p>
