      <h2>Wildlife at Jacob Smith Park</h2>
      <p>Stepping through the gate into the park, you will find a peaceful semi-wild area, with a mosaic of habitats, home to a wide range of wildlife.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Habitats -->
    <section class="habitats">
      <h3>Habitats</h3>
      <p>In its most recent history, the park was grazing land, and the grasslands still remain the dominant habitat. But even within this, there is variety. In the summer, strongly growing tall grasses tower above you, hiding the view of the park. In other areas, barely ankle high, herbs and wildflowers can be found. There are also small areas of mixed deciduous woodland, wildlife ponds, damp meadows and scrub hedging round the perimeter.</p>

      <h3>The Park Through the Seasons</h3>

      <article class="season-block winter">
        <h4>‚ùÑÔ∏è Winter & New Year</h4>
        <p>At the start of the year, even with frosty nights, the spring butterflies start to emerge from February, many species laying eggs on the early growth of nettles and garlic mustard. Mole activity becomes apparent as they establish new tunnels in their search for food, and hundreds of molehills appear.</p>
        <p>The territorial drumming of greater spotted woodpeckers can be heard across the park, while rooks return to their rookery near the entrance to repair their nests. Old oak trees with hollows provide nest sites for nuthatch and tits, and song thrushes sing along the northern boundary.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="season-block spring">
        <h4>üå∏ Spring</h4>
        <p>By early April, swallows and house martins arrive from Africa, feeding over grasslands and gathering mud for nests by the pond. By late April, swifts have returned, joining the feeding frenzy.</p>
        <p>Late spring brings colourful wildflowers: red and white clover for pollinators, seas of buttercups, and masses of common spotted and northern marsh orchids.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="season-block summer">
        <h4>‚òÄÔ∏è Summer</h4>
        <p>With warm weather, grassland butterflies appear in huge numbers ‚Äî around 20 species, nearly half of all UK species. The park is perfect for taking part in The Big Butterfly Count in mid-July.</p>
        <p>Dragonflies and damselflies patrol grasslands and ponds: emperor dragonflies, common blue damselflies, and broad-bodied chasers are common, with the striking metallic blue demoiselle found near shaded ponds. Foxes are occasionally seen, and early visitors might spot deer grazing.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="season-block autumn">
        <h4>üçÇ Autumn</h4>
        <p>Autumn brings ivy flowers and ripening fruit ‚Äî apples, plums, hips, haws and elderberry ‚Äî feeding wildlife before winter. Butterflies feed on ivy nectar, squirrels cache nuts, and birds of prey hunt voles and shrews in the cut grasslands.</p>

    <!-- Ancient Trees -->
    <section class="ancient-trees">
      <h3>The Value of Ancient Trees</h3>
      <p>Jacob Smith Park has 22 trees listed in the Woodland Trust Ancient Tree Inventory ‚Äî all but one are oak species. Some are believed to be 400‚Äì500 years old, potentially planted as part of a deer park. Ancient oaks can support up to 2,300 species, making them a vital habitat for insects, birds, mammals and fungi.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Watercourses -->
    <section class="watercourses">
      <h3>Watercourses & Springs</h3>
      <p>The park has three ponds, two for wildlife and one seasonal drainage pool. In wet winters, water flows diagonally across the park connecting the ponds. Underground springs can sometimes be heard in the meadow after heavy rain, supporting damp-loving plants like hairy willowherb, cuckoo flower, goat willow, dogwoods and ragged robin.</p>
